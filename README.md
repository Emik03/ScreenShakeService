Screen Shake Service simply supports slashing Scooped Swordsman's (Hollow Knight's) superfluous screen shake since said shaking stimulates some souls' squeamishness.

Originally made in 2021, this mod is extremely light, having virtually no more overhead than an empty mod.

This project has a dependency to [Emik.Morsels](https://github.com/Emik03/Emik.Morsels), if you are building this project, refer to its [README](https://github.com/Emik03/Emik.Morsels/blob/main/README.md) first.
